# Security Policy for BraveGoggles-Configuration-Standard-Development-Kit

## Vulnerability Reporting

Brave Search is committed to the security of its users and the integrity of its products. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you believe you have found a security issue in this repository, please report it via the following channels:

*   **Primary Method:** Open a **private vulnerability report** through GitHub's security advisory feature. Navigate to the main page of this repository, click on the 'Security' tab, and then select 'Advisories' followed by 'New draft security advisory'. This ensures your report is handled securely and confidentially.
*   **Alternative Method:** If you are unable to use GitHub's private reporting, please send an encrypted email to `security@brave.com` with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report - BraveGoggles-Configuration-Standard-Development-Kit".

## Reporting Guidelines

When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide as much of the following information as possible:

*   **Affected Repository:** `chirag127/BraveGoggles-Configuration-Standard-Development-Kit`
*   **Description:** A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including any necessary configuration or environment setup.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** If available, a minimal PoC demonstrating the vulnerability.
*   **Impact Assessment:** Your assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Suggested Mitigation:** Any suggestions for how the vulnerability could be fixed.

## Disclosure Policy

We ask that you not disclose any vulnerabilities to the public until we have had a reasonable time to investigate and address the issue. Brave Search will strive to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and will provide updates on the status of the investigation and resolution.

Once a vulnerability has been addressed, we will work with you to determine an appropriate time for public disclosure.

## Supported Versions

This repository is actively maintained. We aim to address reported vulnerabilities in the latest stable version of the code. Security fixes may be backported to previous versions at our discretion.

## What is NOT considered a security issue?

*   Findings of missing security headers (unless they allow for a specific, demonstrable exploit).
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities that require a significant, unrealistic level of effort to execute.
*   Issues that have been publicly disclosed already.
*   Problems that are not specific to this repository's code (e.g., issues with third-party libraries that are not explicitly bundled or maintained by this project, unless a specific exploit is demonstrated).

Thank you for helping keep the BraveGoggles-Configuration-Standard-Development-Kit secure!
